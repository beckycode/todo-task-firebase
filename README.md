## Learning
I didn't know how to deploy a simple project with no frameworks and connected to firebase. I had to learn how to do it with Netlify.
A script helped me, so basically this is a project only with HTML, CSS, JS and Firebase.
I also added the credentials directly to Netlify and learnt how to handle secrets in code to prevent to make them public in the code.

Definitely a new experience! ðŸ˜„
